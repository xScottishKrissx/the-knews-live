Part 1 - Implement the front end UI:
     ☐ Build from a mobile first approach
        ☐ Design should be responsive
     ☐ Focus on the non-logged functionality
     ✔ Add Logged in functionality as a secondary feature @done(20-07-29 15:53)
     ✔ Most important is the ability to click on a link, go to a new page and then back again @done(20-07-29 15:53)
     ✘ With that core in place then add the CMS elements. @cancelled(20-10-12 15:36)


Part 2 - Back to Work:
        ✔ Figure out how to use the do-list again @done(20-10-12 17:40)
        ✔ Get the blog back up and running @done(20-10-12 17:40)
        ✔ Get Portfolio back up and running @done(20-10-12 17:40)
        ✔ Get comfortable with react again. @done(20-10-12 17:40)
        ✔ Probably take a couple of refreshers for JavaScript, it's been a while @done(20-10-12 17:40)

Known Bugs:
        ✔ If you middle click or try to open a news item in a new tab, you can an error @started(18-07-25 11:58) @done(18-08-01 11:03) @lasted(6d23h5m12s)
        ✔ Typing in localhost:3000newsitem will return a blank screen @done(18-08-10 17:39)

        ✔ If you refresh the page anywhere you return to home @started(18-08-07 16:07) @done(18-08-07 16:17) @lasted(10m37s)
            I fixed these 2 errors by messing with the switch statement but I think this will mess up on deployment. 
        ✔ If you refresh the page on the form you get a setState error. @started(18-08-07 16:07) @done(18-08-22 12:35) @lasted(2w20h28m58s)
            It's because the component makes a call to the database and sets state on the home page as soon as it loads. if you refresh on a news page and try to go back it hasnt done that yet and doesnt like it.
            
        ✔ The html parser stopped working after the port @done(18-08-07 16:07)
            I don't know how i fixed this. All I did was uncomment everything and it worked.
        
        ☐ When deployed, if you login with an article in the database the website UI doesnt update to reflect this. You need to manually refresh the page before the correct UI appears.
        ✔ When loading articles on scroll, the first 4 articles are repeats of the last 4 from the database. @started(20-09-17 18:55) @done(20-09-21 16:45) @lasted(3d21h50m48s)
            This is less of a bug and more of a incomplete feature that is working as expected given the current code.
        ☐ Due to the placeholder text, some elements don't fit into the design. Ideally I could set rules like max characters but I am really relying on the lorem ipsum being of a reasonable length.(which it sometimes isn't) @started(20-10-27 17:43)
            ☐ I could repopulate the database, ensuring my own rules, which might help solve the problem. @started(20-10-27 17:44)

        ✔ Let's try with the tag page as test case @done(12:28 - 22/12/20)
            // 15/12 - I think it's possible, i just need to work out how to get the articles array into the correct format in and out of state across the components.
            // 17/12 - Breakthrough...maybe? Passing the array as a prop just gives me object object which is where I've been stuck. Getting it into an array to be used for the .map was the sticking point here. However, a stackOverflow user suggested turning the array into a string before setting it into localstorage, and then parsing it back into an array.
            // This seems to have done the trick, with the array now being passed as an actual array and not objects.
            // This doesnt mean I'm anywhere finished with this, as the scrolling isnt working correctly which I think is the same issue as above. Arrays not actually being arrays.
            Progress at least.
            // so.... it's possible that I have actually succeeded in moving the scroll component to it's own thing. My problem is that the tags page may never have been working correctly in the first place so I'm not 100% sure what's right or wrong. I'm going to leave this for today because I'm so utterly confused by what I've done that I'm not sure what's up or down anymore.
            Tommorow i'll plug the scroll component into the homepage(because I know that's actually working) or fix the tags page.
            18/12 - Priority is to get the tags page working -> It should only be showing articles with the current tag (ie sports page should only show sports tagged pages)
            // Ok some progress. I can get the tags page working as expected by hardcoding the database values into the query. Not a solution but at least I know what the problem is. The ScrollCheck component can also be configured to work this way although instead of loading new articles it's loading the same articles already on the page. Again, not a solution but I know what I need to work on.
            // It's working...mostly. It's now outputting the correct articles from the database onto the page and not overwriting everything as it was previously. The only catch is that the database query is still hardcoded in so i'll need to fix that next.
            ✔ The scrolling works from all of the tag page but NOT when accessing tags via the article page @done(11:14 - 22/12/20)
                // The issue is that the scrollCheck code isn't searching the database for "Sports" etc, its searching for "tag".
                // Solved this by using a simple or check for both the options the database can search for.
            ✔ How does the scrollcheck work with: @done(11:37 - 22/12/20)
                ✔ Post Date @done(11:37 - 22/12/20)
                ✔ Author @done(11:37 - 22/12/20)
            ✔ Would passing the dbRef as a prop make the query step much simpler? @done(12:16 - 22/12/20)
                // So doing this via tagbar
                    -- Everything works as expected.
                // via the article page
                    -- Post date works fine

                ✔ So now that that works, what about plugging the home page scroll into the scrollcheck component? @done(12:16 - 22/12/20)
                    // Well it worked for the most part. Got a few presentational glitches but the actual component is working as expected.
                ☐ The main issue now is that I now think i need a separate component for the view that deals with the cards themselves.

                    // I think I know what has happeneed. I was in the middle of creating a new component responsible for the output of the cards. This could be used on the homepage and in tags which would reduce duplication and simplify the workflow.

                    // With that fixed i still think the render cards component is a good idea. The newsitemloopview is still a chunky piece of code. Splitting the actual view of the cards into their own thing will cut down on the size of the file and make it more manageable.

            // Still though, I have managed to create an infinite scrolling UI so that's cool
            ✘ 21/9/2020 - Current idea is to use state with local storage to store and retrieve scroll position when moving back and forward. @started(20-09-21 15:17) @cancelled(20-10-12 17:38) @wasted(3w2h21m6s)
                21/9 - This is actually fairly simple, the main issue is that I can't get the page to scroll. I think this is likely an issue with css and how the javascript interacts with the page and overall body.
                21/9 - Ok so I actually have this working sort of...I have a button that will take you to your previous position but you need to click it multiple times as it loads the articles back up to that point. Not ideal but i'll take that as a win.
                21/9 - Maybe I should be putting everything into local storage here? Like the numbers of articles already loaded and then just reload that number straight from the database on returning from the article.
                12/10 - I have spent way too long on this so I'm calling it quits. I can't figure out how to get around the way I am currently rendering the news item and then scrolling to through separate renders. Maybe I could figure it out but I really need to move on at this point.
                12/10 - I will come back to this as a concept at a later point

                    6/11/2020 - My wee monkey brain is having a hard time figuring this one out. My thinking WAS that if I add the id of the item I hide to an array then check that array against the initial load, removing an object that matches, then I could render just the posts I want to view.
                    // This hasn't worked out at this point,

                    10/11/2020 - Breakthrough!!
                        I've been able to hide a single post by checking an array for id's(stored in local storage) of articles that have been hidden.
                        It only works with a single article in the hidden posts array... so obviously that's an issue, but at the very least I've made significant progress here.
                    10/11/2020
                        Well I've managed to get the swipe to hide multiple posts at a time... the only problem is that when i refresh and swipe away new posts, my previous swipes are overwritten, bringing back the old hidden posts. I'll count that as progress.Please.

                        Got it working as expected. You can hide multiple articles and they will remain hidden as you work your way through the website. I did this by simply adding a check on component mount that checks the local storage for a list of hidden posts. If it's there it checks the artice id and hides the relevant articles, if not it initialises the with an empty array.

                        I guess the only reason is that I spent the time to create the code for detecting smaller windows and now that it's in place I don't want to remove it. :-(

                                11/12/2020 - Let's find out.
                                14/12/2020 - Managed to createa button that lets you hide articles from the article page itself. I have run into an error that happens when there is nothing in local storage.
                                I've put in some more work and managed to make progress but there's some weirdness going on...
                                    What works
                                        Empty Cache -> Hiding on home  -> then hiding in article  - Works as intended
                                        Empty Cache -> Hiding in article -> hide on home === home article doesnt stay hidden on page refresh (cache issue likely)
                                        Empty Cache -> Hide Home -> Hide Home - Works As intended
                                        Empty Cache -> Hide in Page -> hide in page -> Works as intended

                                ... here's an idea. What if I just use the current article button in the article page as a component on the home page. Why don't I just replace the current div i'm using as a hide button with the same component in the article??
                                ... Yeah thats much better. The styles are completley broken but the code works perfectly which it should as instead of messing around with different caches and updating state, i just use the same code base for the 2 "different" buttons.

        ✔ If you click on a News Item at Home you should get a unique shareable URL @done(18-07-31 17:19)
            ✔ Right now you get a path simply ends with news-item @done(18-07-25 17:09)
            I think this is possible but I will need to go more in deapth with Routes
                I solved a part of this by adding arraymap.id to the path
                However the link is still not shareable at this point
                I think this now has something to do with the onClick event because the data is loaded from an external file on click. If there's no click then there is not data loaded to state which returns an error.
            ✔ Work out how to get by the onClick to load. @done(18-07-26 15:39)
                 So I think I have an idea
                 I use parameters to move the id from the home to the news item and then run the .map again to retrieve the rest of the data.
                 Right now I am getting all of the data when the page loads. 
                 My idea is to only get the article id,title and image
                 Using that when you click on an item you go the article with the rest of the content ready.
                 Well that didn't work and now I am a bit stumped.
                 I am going to go back to basics and create a map that returns the dummy data when the page is rendered to a hard-coded ID
            ✔ Created Unique pages with shareable URLS @done(18-07-26 15:36)
                  The main problem with my approach is that the ID needs to match up with the array. The array goes from 0 to 9 so if there isnt an entry with an id of 0 then you get an error. This would be a problem when the design starts to scale and you start adding and removing things from the database. 
                
                 Its also dependant on the for loop so its not at all flexible but I am not sure how else to approach something like this at the moment
                
                 I think I need to do this in reverse. Use the id from the json data to set the URL param and display the news items and their content based on the id from url.

                 I'm still a bit unsure how to proceed but an interesting and good challenge.

                 Ok so maybe if I rework my loop I can make this more dynamic and flexible. THe entire rigidity of the design comes from the loop setting a value of i for the ID that increments every it loops. If I can somehow rework the entire thing maybe I could have i correspond in someway to the values within the json data. How the hell i do that I don't know but I can give it a crack 

                 I am going to call it a day I think as I am in a bit of haze from starting at the same pieces of code for hours. I do think i'm not that for from a solution though, I just need to look the way I am looping through the external data. The issue is definitley there...probably.

                 I made some branches and tried some things but I didnt get very far. The good news is that I have successfully created unique shareable pages that can be manually typed in. The bad news is that the design only works if the id's in the database go from 0 to whatever. If you have an id like 342 then it won't work. I feel like the solution is right in front of me but I just can't get it. Very frustrating. 

                 I have given it a long time and a really good shot but I just don't know how to fix this. It's not a big deal and doesn't actually affect this project but it's something I need to pick up for the future. Maybe next project will be built around this.

                 I am going to spend this final day on this and see if I can do anything. If I can't then tommorow I will move on because this has already taken up too much time and it's not even a roadblock for this project.

                 I might have got somewhere by ripping up the entire system and starting again with a new map instead of using a for loop. Now the system loops through the objects within the file and returns those objects. Specifically i now have the database id and array id as seperatw values to work with. I'm not in the clear yet but I am in a better position than i was at the least.

                 I have managed to solve this but explaining it is a bit tricky because i'm not sure how to actually start. Basically i used match.params.id to get the identifier along with js .find and map functions. I will try and go into more detail later.

                    // This might open a can of worms...i'm just saying.
                    // Some solutions
                        // Looks like using immutability-helper is a good place to start, with my first idea being to simply update the state of articles array everytime the hide article button is clicked. When clicked, the array updates with a new value added to the relevant field. If this field is found in the initial array, it's just removed from the array.
                        This is different from the current solution as the articles are just hidden via css, updating state allows me to fill a full array with objects that don't have "hidden" in them....i think. That's my idea.
                        // Whether it's viable I will probably spend the next month finding out -- CD 15/3/2021
                        // I've figured out how to edit individual properities in an array of objects which is cool...
                        // ...but it doesn't solve the problem of not having enough articles in the initial load.
                        // Ideally it works like:
                            Initial Load from database -> 
                            Removal of matching object value -> 
                            Remove from array -> 
                            Go to next record -> 
                            Repeat until 30 records in array -> 
                            Pass Array to News Item Loop View
                        // I just removed an object from one array and appended a record from a second array to the end of the first, keeping the number of obejects in the array at maximum.
                        //  Is there something here? Could I just run a loop that ensures the array length remains at 30 on load?

                        ✔ 22/3/2021 - Ok, so i have the new code working as intended. The only small probem is that I can't figure out how to undo it. I can hide an article and have it replaced with another, ensuring a minimum of 30 articles in the initial array, but I can't get the website to load a fresh array.
                            ✔ To fix this I added a line to the clear cache component that resets the array of filtered articles to blank, meaning the website reverts to the using the default articles from the inital call. @done(16:01 - 24/03/21)

                        23/3/2021 -
                        ✔ If you hide an article, the article added to the array is pulled from the same static array of leftover articles. This is a problem as it means the same articles are just duplicated over and over again. 
                            ✔ I fixed the above by changing the way the 2 arrays (current articles and leftover articles) are spliced together. So now the articles I would expect to be added to the page are. However, i'm still seing some instances where hiding an article sort of resets the array so it starts repeating seqences of articles. I have been unable to replicate this issue. @started(15:59 - 24/03/21) @done(17:51 - 26/03/21) @lasted(2d1h52m49s)

                            ✔ ....IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE I HAVE ALL OF THE CODE RUNNING WHEN THE PAGE RENDERS INSTEAD OF IN THE HIDE ARTICLE COMPONENT BECAUSE CLEARLY THAT'S TOO HARD FOR ME TO WORK OUT SO EVERYTIME THE PAGE RENDERS THE SLICING CODE AND ARRAY APPENDING HAPPENS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE HIDE ARTICLE BUTTON WAS CLICKED WHICH IS THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF WHAT IVE BEEN DOING THAT LAST WEEK. HOW HAS IT TAKEN ME THIS LONG TO NOTICE THIS!!!??!?!?!?!?!??!??!?!?!?!? @done(17:58 - 26/03/21)

                        ✔ I have completed the meat of the problem, you can hide articles with an article replacing it at the end of the array. My main method was to break it down, step by step and work through the problem. My main failure was initially building the codebase in the render of news-item-loop-view.js. This caused major issues so my second attempt at this, primarily inside the hide-article.js proved much easier and less troublesome.
                            ☐ Integrate the following with the new hide functionality:
                                ☐ The in article hide article button
                                ☐ Swiping to hide
                                ☐ Scroll Check
                                ☐ Next/Prev 
                                    // ...this will be much better and more usable than before. The previous hide article functionality didn't change the array of article loaded, so next/prev would navigate to articles that should be hidden. My new solution supplies a changed array each time an article is hidden, so next/prev will only go to non hidden articles.
                            ☐ Bugs / Errors / Issues:
                                ☐ Hiding all articles will eventually return a null id error.
                                ☐ If the database has more than 60 articles(it does) the code currently doesn't support rendering those articles.
                                ☐ Loading replacement articles as articles are hidden would be a good addition.(but i don't know how to do that)

                // Ive completed most of the work with both tags and home using the same scrollCheck component.
                // The only issue is how i'm slicing the arrays and where the start point for render on scroll should be. Luckily this is only a problem because the number of articles with tags is uneven and low, so if I add more tags then there should be no issue. The issue is that the number of sports tags is lower than the initially loaded homepage articles, which would cut off articles. Again, if I add more tags to articles this isn't an issue and is only a problem because the project is still in development and there's a lack of actual content,.

                        ... so stack overflow just pulled one out of the bag.

                        I changed back to my old method of having the tag page accessing the database rather than the bar. The old issue was that the page wouldnt update because the components don't update unless something changes. The code I found on stackoverflow adds a timestamp to the Router so that everytime the link is clicked the route gets a new timestamp which lets the component controlling the tag page view update.

                // I thin the duplication is down to the scrollCheck having a render component that immediately displays its contents as soon as the component is mounted. I want the contents of the scrollCheck component to only show when the page is scrolled.
                // I think i solved the problem... even if im not sure how. I think it was down to incorrectly setting the parameters of the newstate.slice in the tags page and arrayStart and End state in scrollCheck.js. Not 100% certain so i'll play around and see if I can figure it out exactly.

        No need to rush this, take your time and work through each challenge one by one.
        This is possible but you might need to go off and some tuturials  research to
