Blog Entry 1
--------------------------
Good lord, so I've managed to add the ability to edit an article which might not mean anything now as I've deleted this entry about 20 times so far.

So here's the bullet points:
<ul>
<li>I've been away from this project for quite a while(years).</li>
<li>My progress when i left was to a point where I can create new articles under a specific logged into user id and get an article with some randomly generated images</li>
<li>I didn't have the ability to edit articles outside of the database once they've been created.</li>
<li>Creating this little edit form was my way of easing myself back into this project and react In general</li>
<li>After much trial and error and about a day of work I managed to implement said form.</li>
<li>I have moved onto adding the ability to also change the title while in the process deleting the original post that existed here.</li>
</ul>
I also want to use these articles as a sort of blog to both document and encourage the development of new features of this project. I realise I could just use various libraries to implement the same functionality in a fraction of the time but I probably wouldn't learn a whole lot other than how to google(which I am quite already quite proficient at)

As of this entry, the form is also hilariously insecure so I will need to address that at some point. Althought I do currently have google authenticated user access for the myKnews page so I think it should be fairly simple to hide the edit button from anyone who doesn't have proper access.

So with the edit functionality sort of solid, I now want to add the ability to change the article title. That shouldn't be too difficult right? just another text box....right?
