Part 1 - Implement the front end UI:
     ☐ Build from a mobile first approach
        ✔ Design should be responsive @done(13:24 - 26/05/21)

     ✔ Add Logged in functionality as a secondary feature @done(20-07-29 15:53)
     ✔ Most important is the ability to click on a link, go to a new page and then back again @done(20-07-29 15:53)
     ✘ With that core in place then add the CMS elements. @cancelled(20-10-12 15:36)

Known Bugs:
        ✔ If you middle click or try to open a news item in a new tab, you can an error @started(18-07-25 11:58) @done(18-08-01 11:03) @lasted(6d23h5m12s)
        ✔ Typing in localhost:3000newsitem will return a blank screen @done(18-08-10 17:39)
        ✔ The random image function returns the same image. Not a big deal but should be fixed before the end. @done(18-07-31 17:41)
        ✔ Any ID that doesn't exists should return an error page. @started(18-08-01 11:47) @done(18-08-29 11:13) @lasted(3w6d23h26m32s)
        ✔ Routing Redirect Error relating to /theKnews/.See the console. @started(18-08-07 16:07) @done(18-08-07 16:17) @lasted(10m39s)
        ✔ If you refresh the page anywhere you return to home @started(18-08-07 16:07) @done(18-08-07 16:17) @lasted(10m37s)
            I fixed these 2 errors by messing with the switch statement but I think this will mess up on deployment. 
        ✔ If you refresh the page on the form you get a setState error. @started(18-08-07 16:07) @done(18-08-22 12:35) @lasted(2w20h28m58s)
            It's because the component makes a call to the database and sets state on the home page as soon as it loads. if you refresh on a news page and try to go back it hasnt done that yet and doesnt like it.
            
        ✔ The html parser stopped working after the port @done(18-08-07 16:07)
            I don't know how i fixed this. All I did was uncomment everything and it worked.
        
        ☐ When deployed, if you login with an article in the database the website UI doesnt update to reflect this. You need to manually refresh the page before the correct UI appears.
        ✔ When loading articles on scroll, the first 4 articles are repeats of the last 4 from the database. @started(20-09-17 18:55) @done(20-09-21 16:45) @lasted(3d21h50m48s)
            This is less of a bug and more of a incomplete feature that is working as expected given the current code.
        ☐ Due to the placeholder text, some elements don't fit into the design. Ideally I could set rules like max characters but I am really relying on the lorem ipsum being of a reasonable length.(which it sometimes isn't) 
            ☐ I could repopulate the database, ensuring my own rules, which might help solve the problem. 

Codebase:

        ✔ Let's try with the tag page as test case @done(12:28 - 22/12/20)
            // 15/12 - I think it's possible, i just need to work out how to get the articles array into the correct format in and out of state across the components.
            // 17/12 - Breakthrough...maybe? Passing the array as a prop just gives me object object which is where I've been stuck. Getting it into an array to be used for the .map was the sticking point here. However, a stackOverflow user suggested turning the array into a string before setting it into localstorage, and then parsing it back into an array.
            // This seems to have done the trick, with the array now being passed as an actual array and not objects.
            // This doesnt mean I'm anywhere finished with this, as the scrolling isnt working correctly which I think is the same issue as above. Arrays not actually being arrays.
            Progress at least.
            // so.... it's possible that I have actually succeeded in moving the scroll component to it's own thing. My problem is that the tags page may never have been working correctly in the first place so I'm not 100% sure what's right or wrong. I'm going to leave this for today because I'm so utterly confused by what I've done that I'm not sure what's up or down anymore.
            Tommorow i'll plug the scroll component into the homepage(because I know that's actually working) or fix the tags page.
            18/12 - Priority is to get the tags page working -> It should only be showing articles with the current tag (ie sports page should only show sports tagged pages)
            // Ok some progress. I can get the tags page working as expected by hardcoding the database values into the query. Not a solution but at least I know what the problem is. The ScrollCheck component can also be configured to work this way although instead of loading new articles it's loading the same articles already on the page. Again, not a solution but I know what I need to work on.
            // It's working...mostly. It's now outputting the correct articles from the database onto the page and not overwriting everything as it was previously. The only catch is that the database query is still hardcoded in so i'll need to fix that next.
            ✔ The scrolling works from all of the tag page but NOT when accessing tags via the article page @done(11:14 - 22/12/20)
                // The issue is that the scrollCheck code isn't searching the database for "Sports" etc, its searching for "tag".
                // Solved this by using a simple or check for both the options the database can search for.
            ✔ How does the scrollcheck work with: @done(11:37 - 22/12/20)
                ✔ Post Date @done(11:37 - 22/12/20)
                ✔ Author @done(11:37 - 22/12/20)
            ✔ Would passing the dbRef as a prop make the query step much simpler? @done(12:16 - 22/12/20)
                // So doing this via tagbar
                    -- Everything works as expected.
                // via the article page
                    -- Post date works fine

                ✔ So now that that works, what about plugging the home page scroll into the scrollcheck component? @done(12:16 - 22/12/20)
                    // Well it worked for the most part. Got a few presentational glitches but the actual component is working as expected.

I would benefit from a single render card component but creating that will break other stuff that I can't figure out how to fix.

                // Back for more and trying to figure out what I was doing with the component in tags.js
                    // I think was attempting to create a new component for rendering the cards.
                    // Yeah, im drawing a blank. Going to do other stuff while I get properly back into the swing of things.

                    // I think I know what has happeneed. I was in the middle of creating a new component responsible for the output of the cards. This could be used on the homepage and in tags which would reduce duplication and simplify the workflow. 
                    
                    // However, in the middle of creating this component I noticed that newsitemloopview.js was the exact thing I was trying to create. All I needed to do was make sure the database call coming in was correct. When I added <NewsItemLoopView databaseProp={new1}/> to the tags.js file, it broke and I couldn't figure out why which is where I stopped for Christmas and New Year.

                    // Knowing all of that I still don't know why it's not working, but I'm convinced it can work and will save me a lot of headache when working with the cards.

                    // Aha, the issue is in the Parser component. This is the component I'm using to properly format my text from the database. If I disable it, the tags page works as expected albeit with no article text.

                    // So the problem is coming from the swipe-left-content.js file where ParseHTML is located. Now to figure out what the issue is.

                    // There's something going wrong the value.text prop, showing as undefined which it shouldnt.

                    // I didn't add the text field to the original database query in tags.js. That's what caused this entire problem.

                    // Yup, the tags page is loading without an error after fixing the database query in tags.js

                    // With that fixed i still think the render cards component is a good idea. The newsitemloopview is still a chunky piece of code. Splitting the actual view of the cards into their own thing will cut down on the size of the file and make it more manageable.

                    // Alhtough now the tags page isn't loading the new articles properly... it's neverending is it? Let's move on.

            //Idea is that the start page has 10 articles to start with, as you scroll more articles load and populate the page
            ✘ Ideally, when you click on the articles, as you return to the home page your position is remembered @cancelled(20-10-12 17:38)
            //Probably add scroll position to local storage.
            // 3/8/2020 - Current Progress -- I have items from the database loading onto page as you scroll.
            // So i have managed to get a different set of articles from the initital call loading onto the page which is good.
            // I'm not sure how, with my current dataset, I can consistently get different records every time.
            // I don't really want to get the entire database at once, count it on the front end and then call the records from that.
            // Or maybe that is the answer, either way I'm not totally sure how to proceed from here.
            // Still though, I have managed to create an infinite scrolling UI so that's cool
            ✘ 21/9/2020 - Current idea is to use state with local storage to store and retrieve scroll position when moving back and forward. @started(20-09-21 15:17) @cancelled(20-10-12 17:38) @wasted(3w2h21m6s)
                21/9 - This is actually fairly simple, the main issue is that I can't get the page to scroll. I think this is likely an issue with css and how the javascript interacts with the page and overall body.
                21/9 - Ok so I actually have this working sort of...I have a button that will take you to your previous position but you need to click it multiple times as it loads the articles back up to that point. Not ideal but i'll take that as a win.
                21/9 - Maybe I should be putting everything into local storage here? Like the numbers of articles already loaded and then just reload that number straight from the database on returning from the article.
                12/10 - I have spent way too long on this so I'm calling it quits. I can't figure out how to get around the way I am currently rendering the news item and then scrolling to through separate renders. Maybe I could figure it out but I really need to move on at this point.
                12/10 - I will come back to this as a concept at a later point

                 Probably the most adjustments at this point

                    6/11/2020 - My wee monkey brain is having a hard time figuring this one out. My thinking WAS that if I add the id of the item I hide to an array then check that array against the initial load, removing an object that matches, then I could render just the posts I want to view.
                    // This hasn't worked out at this point,

                    10/11/2020 - Breakthrough!!
                        I've been able to hide a single post by checking an array for id's(stored in local storage) of articles that have been hidden.
                        It only works with a single article in the hidden posts array... so obviously that's an issue, but at the very least I've made significant progress here.
                    10/11/2020
                        Well I've managed to get the swipe to hide multiple posts at a time... the only problem is that when i refresh and swipe away new posts, my previous swipes are overwritten, bringing back the old hidden posts. I'll count that as progress.Please.
                    16/11/2020
                        Got it working as expected. You can hide multiple articles and they will remain hidden as you work your way through the website. I did this by simply adding a check on component mount that checks the local storage for a list of hidden posts. If it's there it checks the artice id and hides the relevant articles, if not it initialises the with an empty array.

                        5/11/2020 - I'm double thinking this now because I'm not sure there's any reason why swipe shouldn't be available on desktop. It works perfectly fine and although not ideal for a mouse, does give the same feeling of dismissing something from view quickly.

                        I guess the only reason is that I spent the time to create the code for detecting smaller windows and now that it's in place I don't want to remove it. :-(

                                11/12/2020 - Let's find out.
                                14/12/2020 - Managed to createa button that lets you hide articles from the article page itself. I have run into an error that happens when there is nothing in local storage.
                                I've put in some more work and managed to make progress but there's some weirdness going on...
                                    What works
                                        Empty Cache -> Hiding on home  -> then hiding in article  - Works as intended
                                        Empty Cache -> Hiding in article -> hide on home === home article doesnt stay hidden on page refresh (cache issue likely)
                                        Empty Cache -> Hide Home -> Hide Home - Works As intended
                                        Empty Cache -> Hide in Page -> hide in page -> Works as intended

                                ... here's an idea. What if I just use the current article button in the article page as a component on the home page. Why don't I just replace the current div i'm using as a hide button with the same component in the article??
                                ... Yeah thats much better. The styles are completley broken but the code works perfectly which it should as instead of messing around with different caches and updating state, i just use the same code base for the 2 "different" buttons.

        ✔ If you click on a News Item at Home you should get a unique shareable URL @done(18-07-31 17:19)
            ✔ Right now you get a path simply ends with news-item @done(18-07-25 17:09)
            I think this is possible but I will need to go more in deapth with Routes
                I solved a part of this by adding arraymap.id to the path
                However the link is still not shareable at this point
                I think this now has something to do with the onClick event because the data is loaded from an external file on click. If there's no click then there is not data loaded to state which returns an error.
            ✔ Work out how to get by the onClick to load. @done(18-07-26 15:39)
                 So I think I have an idea
                 I use parameters to move the id from the home to the news item and then run the .map again to retrieve the rest of the data.
                 Right now I am getting all of the data when the page loads. 
                 My idea is to only get the article id,title and image
                 Using that when you click on an item you go the article with the rest of the content ready.
                 Well that didn't work and now I am a bit stumped.
                 I am going to go back to basics and create a map that returns the dummy data when the page is rendered to a hard-coded ID
            ✔ Created Unique pages with shareable URLS @done(18-07-26 15:36)
                  The main problem with my approach is that the ID needs to match up with the array. The array goes from 0 to 9 so if there isnt an entry with an id of 0 then you get an error. This would be a problem when the design starts to scale and you start adding and removing things from the database. 
                
                 Its also dependant on the for loop so its not at all flexible but I am not sure how else to approach something like this at the moment
                
                 I think I need to do this in reverse. Use the id from the json data to set the URL param and display the news items and their content based on the id from url.

                 I'm still a bit unsure how to proceed but an interesting and good challenge.

                 Ok so maybe if I rework my loop I can make this more dynamic and flexible. THe entire rigidity of the design comes from the loop setting a value of i for the ID that increments every it loops. If I can somehow rework the entire thing maybe I could have i correspond in someway to the values within the json data. How the hell i do that I don't know but I can give it a crack 

                 I am going to call it a day I think as I am in a bit of haze from starting at the same pieces of code for hours. I do think i'm not that for from a solution though, I just need to look the way I am looping through the external data. The issue is definitley there...probably.

                 I made some branches and tried some things but I didnt get very far. The good news is that I have successfully created unique shareable pages that can be manually typed in. The bad news is that the design only works if the id's in the database go from 0 to whatever. If you have an id like 342 then it won't work. I feel like the solution is right in front of me but I just can't get it. Very frustrating. 

                 I have given it a long time and a really good shot but I just don't know how to fix this. It's not a big deal and doesn't actually affect this project but it's something I need to pick up for the future. Maybe next project will be built around this.

                 I am going to spend this final day on this and see if I can do anything. If I can't then tommorow I will move on because this has already taken up too much time and it's not even a roadblock for this project.

                 I might have got somewhere by ripping up the entire system and starting again with a new map instead of using a for loop. Now the system loops through the objects within the file and returns those objects. Specifically i now have the database id and array id as seperatw values to work with. I'm not in the clear yet but I am in a better position than i was at the least.

                 I have managed to solve this but explaining it is a bit tricky because i'm not sure how to actually start. Basically i used match.params.id to get the identifier along with js .find and map functions. I will try and go into more detail later.

                        This is different from the current solution as the articles are just hidden via css, updating state allows me to fill a full array with objects that don't have "hidden" in them....i think. That's my idea.
                        // Whether it's viable I will probably spend the next month finding out -- CD 15/3/2021
                        // I've figured out how to edit individual properities in an array of objects which is cool...
                        // ...but it doesn't solve the problem of not having enough articles in the initial load.
                        // Ideally it works like:
                            Initial Load from database -> 
                            Removal of matching object value -> 
                            Remove from array -> 
                            Go to next record -> 
                            Repeat until 30 records in array -> 
                            Pass Array to News Item Loop View
                        // I just removed an object from one array and appended a record from a second array to the end of the first, keeping the number of obejects in the array at maximum.
                        //  Is there something here? Could I just run a loop that ensures the array length remains at 30 on load?

                        ✔ 22/3/2021 - Ok, so i have the new code working as intended. The only small probem is that I can't figure out how to undo it. I can hide an article and have it replaced with another, ensuring a minimum of 30 articles in the initial array, but I can't get the website to load a fresh array.
                            ✔ To fix this I added a line to the clear cache component that resets the array of filtered articles to blank, meaning the website reverts to the using the default articles from the inital call. @done(16:01 - 24/03/21)

                        23/3/2021 -
                        ✔ If you hide an article, the article added to the array is pulled from the same static array of leftover articles. This is a problem as it means the same articles are just duplicated over and over again. 
                            ✔ I fixed the above by changing the way the 2 arrays (current articles and leftover articles) are spliced together. So now the articles I would expect to be added to the page are. However, i'm still seing some instances where hiding an article sort of resets the array so it starts repeating seqences of articles. I have been unable to replicate this issue. @started(15:59 - 24/03/21) @done(17:51 - 26/03/21) @lasted(2d1h52m49s)
                            ✔ I am also seeing random null id errors popping up. Again, I have been unable to replicate these but I think they may have something to do with when i restart the server each day. @started(15:59 - 24/03/21) @done(17:51 - 26/03/21) @lasted(2d1h52m46s)
                            ✔ When loading a new article, the sequence is skipping the first article in the array, always loading the second article. @started(16:10 - 24/03/21) @done(17:51 - 26/03/21) @lasted(2d1h41m43s)

                            ✔ ....IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE I HAVE ALL OF THE CODE RUNNING WHEN THE PAGE RENDERS INSTEAD OF IN THE HIDE ARTICLE COMPONENT BECAUSE CLEARLY THAT'S TOO HARD FOR ME TO WORK OUT SO EVERYTIME THE PAGE RENDERS THE SLICING CODE AND ARRAY APPENDING HAPPENS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE HIDE ARTICLE BUTTON WAS CLICKED WHICH IS THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF WHAT IVE BEEN DOING THAT LAST WEEK.

                        ✔ I have completed the meat of the problem, you can hide articles with an article replacing it at the end of the array. My main method was to break it down, step by step and work through the problem. My main failure was initially building the codebase in the render of news-item-loop-view.js. This caused major issues so my second attempt at this, primarily inside the hide-article.js proved much easier and less troublesome.

Luckily this is only a problem because the number of articles with tags is uneven and low, so if I add more tags then there should be no issue. The issue is that the number of sports tags is lower than the initially loaded homepage articles, which would cut off articles. Again, if I add more tags to articles this isn't an issue and is only a problem because the project is still in development and there's a lack of actual content,.

                        20/10/2020 - So I have the items re-rerendering with the correct items... but it takes exactly 3 clicks in the tagbar for the items to appear. Everytime. No idea what's going on but I will take this as "progress"...

                        ... so stack overflow just pulled one out of the bag.

                        I changed back to my old method of having the tag page accessing the database rather than the bar. The old issue was that the page wouldnt update because the components don't update unless something changes. The code I found on stackoverflow adds a timestamp to the Router so that everytime the link is clicked the route gets a new timestamp which lets the component controlling the tag page view update.

                        No idea if this is the correct way of doing this or not but the effect is what I wanted and I'm not getting any warnings or errors.

    Rethink Articles:
        ✔ This little project might not go anywhere but I want see if I can take what I've learned from tags and apply that to the article pages. More specifically I want to see if I can design a method by which articles can be loaded and switched on a button press. Currently, articles are loaded using a rigid set of props being passed through components and while this might be the best solution, it makes it difficult to switch between articles wthout using redirects(which i would like to avoid). Basically, i want to make it as easy to switch between articles as it is to switch between the tag filters on the home page. Like I said, this might not work but I want to give it a go and see what happens. @done(16:35 - 06/07/21)
            ✔ In the end, i created liteKnews which filled this gap. Articles need to remain unique things that can be accessed whenever...wait a minute. I just changed my method accessing articles to use ID...instead of key. So..isn't this the exact same thing as liteKnews? All im doing in liteKnews is changing id. PLUS! the new recommended news section literally just requieres and id... @done(16:35 - 06/07/21)
                ✔ this might be possible -> V12.9 @done(16:35 - 06/07/21)
            To-Do:
                ✔ Get a very basic article switching component up and running(changing id's on button press etc) @done(13:42 - 15/04/21)
                --Getting a basic article switcher is simple enough, it's how to advance from here that is befuddling me. Ideally it would work like
                     All Cards are rendered as normal
                     Click on card
                     All Card view is removed
                     View with article is displayed
                    ✔ The popup does actually function like this, so perhaps I could modify that to just be the default article view. @done(18:05 - 15/04/21)
                    It might also be easier to switch articles.

                ✔ My above method is actually looking pretty encouraging. I can open up an article and switch back and forward on button press. @done(18:03 - 15/04/21)
                ✔ So having created my idea, i'm now seeing a problem -- accessible url links. I'm not sure how to ensure you can also have shareable links. Thinking back it's the reason tags have both filters and a tag page. Perhaps I can have both. This new article view could be a more advanced popup, with just the barebones of the article, while still having the full article, with shareable links, social aspects etc. I would essentially be back to where i started and I would have to decide what to do withe next/prev nav controls. I might have another go at making them work seeing as I have what I wanted with the new popup/article view. @done(18:03 - 15/04/21)
                    ✔ So i've gone ahead and replaced the old popup with this new system. It's a lot better and allows me to have both quick switching low clutter articles as well as more feature rich, shareable article pages. @done(18:03 - 15/04/21)

            // I may have solved it. I think the issue was with the clearCache component that triggers on clearing the cache. Previously I was clearing everything but I have changed the button to only clear the hiddenPostList from cache. With that the page is working as expected although there are some issues

                // I thin the duplication is down to the scrollCheck having a render component that immediately displays its contents as soon as the component is mounted. I want the contents of the scrollCheck component to only show when the page is scrolled.
                // I think i solved the problem... even if im not sure how. I think it was down to incorrectly setting the parameters of the newstate.slice in the tags page and arrayStart and End state in scrollCheck.js. Not 100% certain so i'll play around and see if I can figure it out exactly.

        Rethinking Tags:
             ✔ I've decided to redo the tags page... and by redo I mean remove altogether. Instead I have switched to using filters. The upside is that everything happens in one page and I don't need to worry about passing props an working with routes. It's a much simpler solution and uses 1 less call to the database. The major downside is that you can no longer directly go to a tag page.

                ✔ So i ended up doing this and then undoing in. The "news/weather/sports" now function as a filter on the home page. The author and postdate in article will use a modified version of the old tags method of using routes to pass props. @done(11:33 - 09/04/21)
                ✔ You can still go to "news" tag page via url params setting state. @done(11:34 - 09/04/21)

                                        Issues:
                                            ☐Sometimes nothing appears on the post date page. I haven't been able to reliably replicate the issue. 
                                            ☐Random articles being added to the home filters. 
                                                ☐They don't have tags
                                                ☐They're the same 4 articles every time it happens
                                                ☐Clearing cache removes them
                                                ☐Appear after hiding anything on a tags page
                                                ☐Reloading the page removes them
                                            ☐Sometimes extra articles are added to the tags page. 

                                    url redirects for tags:
                                        ✔ My current attempt is to use another component(modified version of tags), would it not be easier to use redirects instead here? @done(13:06 - 14/04/21)
                                            ✔ A bit of both, removed the props from the code and instead just used parameters to query the search term. I'm also using 2 separate components, one for search(tags3.1) and another for clicking through the article(TagsV3). @done(10:03 - 12/04/21)
                                            ✔ The end result is that you can type search in the bar along with an author and go straight to that page if it exists. @done(10:03 - 12/04/21)
                                            ✔ I would like to see if I can unify these so that's my next step. @started(10:03 - 12/04/21) @done(12:50 - 14/04/21) @lasted(2d2h47m37s)
                                                ✔ Possible Breakthrough - So my attempt at using url params and switching the database call was being difficult due to needing 2 different database calls. I may have gotten around this requirement by simply adding a second required parameter to the url path. This allows me to specify which records to query much more precisely than before. It is case sensitive so home/search/tag/news will not work unless News is capitalised.
                                                ✔ While not full complete, I do consider having the 2 tags files merged as complete. There are issues to be resolved but i am happy with the overall solution and so marking this section as done. @done(12:50 - 14/04/21)

                                                        ✔ Hiding works one way at the moment, if you hide an article on home it will be hidden if you go straight to tags. Howerver, if you do it the other way, things break down. @done(12:43 - 14/04/21)
                                                        ✔ The reason being that the database call in tags3.1 is only calling the records specific to that page. In order for hiding to properly work, there needs to be at least 1 full call of the database articles. Without that populted array, the hide component takes that single article array, hides the objects(as expected) and renders the array on home(again as expected) @done(12:43 - 14/04/21)

                            ☐At the least, having a separate component for the large UI bar will make managing it much easier. Also possibility for further fragmentation of buttons into their own components if I wanted.
                            ☐Should function exactly the same as it currently does in the UI bar.
                            ☐Should be flexible enough to add/remove buttons where relevant.
                        To-Do:
                            ✔ Create New component @done(16:41 - 02/06/21)
                            ✔ Integrate Bookmarks page @done(12:08 - 16/06/21)
                                ✔ removed liteknews and bookmark button @done(16:44 - 02/06/21)
                                ✔ Integrate filter options @done(17:38 - 08/06/21)
                                    ✔ What do I want here? Do i want this to be the same as the home page or be different? It makes sense to be different but I can also see the argument for having the same filter throughout and let the user decide on their own. A single filter choice is easier to implement but separate filters seems more user friendly...or it could be seen as 1 more thing to think about. I don't know, might flip a coin 21 times or so.
                                        ✔ I don't know what is the "optimal" choice but I am going with separate filters. If nothing else it's an interesting challenge for me to overcome. @done(17:11 - 08/06/21)
                                            ✔ I've split the two and the home page is working fine. The bookmark page works fine if you press the filter button. However, on render you just get a blank page and I haven't been able to find a solution at this point. @done(17:55 - 02/06/21)
                                    ✔ There is an issue with the react.bootstrap dropdown menu and the render of my bookmark page. Specifically, the bookmark page will render a blank page because the content of the dropdown menu(which control the filters) arent activated until the menu is activated. This is an issue because it means my filter options component is activated until the dropdown is activated, leaving the mentioned empty page for bookmarks. My workaround is to add the filterOptions component to the bookmark page and hide it's ui the same way i have for the card size on the home page. Not great but i can't see any other option here. @done(12:42 - 03/06/21)

                                    ✔ I have a counter that counts the articles when adding/removing bookmarks. It doesnt change with the filter view however. @done(13:02 - 08/06/21)
                                        ✔ This solution was actually correct but I had a spelling mistake with bookmarkCounter, should be bookmarksCount. With that corrected the counter displays the number of bookmarks as you move through the section. @done(13:02 - 08/06/21)
                                    ✘ Same as above but for read/unread. @cancelled(12:08 - 16/06/21)

                                ✔ I think it would be useful to have the number of articles for each filter appear in the menu dropdown. @done(16:08 - 08/06/21)

                                    ✔ I've decided to change the bookmark bar into a dropdown menu that is activated by clicking on the existing bookmarks button. This will save me space and be more usable as I won't need to remove any information at lower screen sizes. @done(16:33 - 09/06/21)
                                    ✔ As a result I have created a new component and I'm currently working on the appearance as all buttons are handled through props and require no changes to work. @done(16:33 - 09/06/21)

I might move the entire bar to the bottom of the page, at least the controls part. Maybe leave the header at the top. @done(16:39 - 15/06/21)
                                        ✘ How about making the scroll back fixed, and adding the scrollUp button to the nav bar? @cancelled(16:37 - 15/06/21)
                                                    ✔ Not everything needs to be added to the navbar and the scroll to top button makes more sense always being in the middle bottom of the page. @done(16:38 - 15/06/21)

                            ✔ Leaving 1 bookmark, if you try to remove that last bookmark, the counter returns to the number before removing bookmarks.So if you have 5, remove 4, and try to remove the last 1 the counter returns to 5. @done(15:50 - 08/06/21)
                                ✔ I think its because the this.state.bookmarkCounter goes to null, which passes the this.state.bookmarks.length to the prop instead. @done(15:47 - 08/06/21)

                                        ✔ Nah, it was already in the navbar. The actual solution is to change the max-width:768 > max-width 767 for the header-wrapper. @done(12:32 - 29/06/21)

                                The main issue is that i am re-rerendering the page everytime an article is bookmarked, which overwrites the filtered views render.
                                Solved it by adding a filter just before setting state in updateBookmarkStatus
                            ✔ bookmark page @done(10:59 - 04/08/21)
                        
                         I want to update the card but I need to update state to do that. I think the best way of doing that is to wrap the renderCard component in a stateful component that can handle state and update bookmarked status.
                             I've moved over to a stateful component to see if I can make this easier.
                                 No luck so far, I can update the array and state but the card controls don't update to reflect the new value. Not sure where to go from here. 
                                 I need this to work so I need to figure this out
                                 There's a a lot of things to consider here. Maybe try and recreate the issue in a smaller scale and work from there.
                                 3/8 - I've done it. You can now add or remove bookmarks using both the buttons and swiping.
                                     The solution was to use both a prop and state within the oncardcontrols and update them to match eatch other when clicking or gesturing.
                                     This involved lifting the state from the oncardcontrols file, into the new state based render card method.
                             Q: Having create the new component, do I actually need state for this??
                                A: I don't need the state but I do need the non-functional component for my code to work

                    ☐ Improved feedback for hiding articles using button

                        ☐ new marked as hide hasn't been integrated with swiping.
                    ✔ Hiding an article should be more than just an instant vanishing act. @done(12:09 - 09/09/21)
                    ✔ Ability to undo a hide @done(12:09 - 09/09/21)

                        ☐ I dont want articles to instantly disappear.
                            ✔ My idea is to "replace" the card with a message that the article will be removed on the next reload of the page. This also gives users the chance to undo if the hide was a miss-click. @done(12:09 - 09/09/21)
                                ✔ to do this i think i need a new row in the database, "marked as Hidden". @done(13:14 - 04/08/21)
                                    ✔ Added the new row and now the card doesnt instantly disappear but vanishes when the page reloads or you activate filters. Next is the UI overlay for the marked as hidden card. @done(13:15 - 04/08/21)
                                ✔ this will be used to sign post that the article can be removed but can appear on screen until a new render. @done(12:09 - 09/09/21)
                                    ✔ created the overlay ui @done(13:35 - 04/08/21)

                                    ✔ issue: bookmarking a card re-rerenders the page and removes the markedforhide cards which i don't want. @done(11:33 - 05/08/21)
                                        ✔ solved this by removing the hideArticle component from the oncardbookmark controls that instantly hid articles, and instead made the website filter out mark for hide articles on component mount in news-item-loop-view. This means you can mark articles as hidden and only when the page reloads will they disappear @done(11:33 - 05/08/21)
                                        ✔ This is a big change but I think its for the better. It gives users a greater degree of control over the interface and also helps with the problem of what happens if you hide all articles on screen without reloading. Now, you're forced to reload the interface which will result in a full page of articles(as long as there's something in the database, another issue still to be solved.) @done(11:39 - 05/08/21)
                                        ✔ to answer the original problem i simply removed the filter from the update bookmark status function in news-item-loop-view. This lead me to change the code as detailed above. @done(11:34 - 05/08/21)
                                    ✔ issue: the card controls are accessible with the overlay active. @done(11:57 - 05/08/21)

This is in answer to a problem where i needed to have markedforhidden to be set as true to show the overlay, but articles markedashidden are removed when setState is called. So now the only time an article is hidden is on mount instead of when the state is set. @done(11:45 - 06/08/21)

This means I need to set the current array bookmarked and then update those changes with the changedFullDatabaseCall. Not quite sure how to do this but i have a vague idea of what I need to do.

It compares the two arrays (one with just the things to be changed, the other the original main array)and changes the original array if both arrays share the same id.

                        in article hide button is unaffected.
                        swipe is unaffected and the hide button works as normal if you swipe first then hide. So im guessing im not properly passing on the main render array at some point.
                        ✔ Yup, i wasn't passing a database call to the hide button in the event of an empty cache. @done(13:49 - 26/08/21)

Part 2 Implement Database functionality:
    ✔ Get information from database. @done(18-08-07 16:03)
    ✔ Create a simple form to submit to the database with basic info @done(18-08-10 11:50)
        No need to rush this, take your time and work through each challenge one by one.
        This is possible but you might need to go off and some tuturials  research to 
        
        Achieved this using a firebase database. I just need to have news articles submit to the database and then returned to a news item.

    ✔ Connect to the database and retrieve a list of objects @done(18-08-08 12:44)
        Success - This was fairly simple, even if I don't quite get some of the code I am getting to grips with a lot of it.I managed to get a single record from the database which is a good start.
    ✔ Use a url param to retrieve an object from the database @done(18-08-08 12:45)
        I don't know how secure this is but it works and I can live with it for the moment

     ✔ Upload all of that to the porfolio @done(18-08-08 12:54)
        The routes are a bit of a mess but that's a deployment problem

     ✘ The News Page themsevles could be loaded using the same db as the home page using props instead of making another seperate call. @cancelled(18-08-13 18:02)
        I think the idea of less work for the database is good but this implementation means I can't navigate directly to the page without going home first.

                ✔ Look at current code and see what can be reused. @done(18:04 - 17/05/21)
                    ✔ I had a look but I think I can do better with what I've learned since I first built the component. Especially now that I don't require being logged in. So im going to build a new component and see what happens. @done(18:04 - 21/05/21)
                ✔ I have a solution in place that lets you vote on articles and have that vote saved throughout the website. It took a while, and multiple iterations of the code, to get the UI just as I want it but I managed it in the end. Of course the main flaw is still the vulnerability to vote manipulation but I don't know to avoid that without requiring a login. @done(18:16 - 21/05/21)

                ✔ I suppose one method would be to update the database and undo the likes/dislikes when clearing the cache but that just seems convoluted and I don't want to go down that route. This project is already running way too long as it is. @done(18:16 - 21/05/21)

                ✔ The Like/Dislike buttons are in place so let's move on. @done(18:16 - 21/05/21)


            Issues:
                 Vulnerable to manipulation, you could clear the cache -> vote and then repeat to upvote an article forever. However, I don't care about that for this project so I choose to ignore it. This is really about me understanding the interaction between React/JavaScript and updating a firebase database.
                 I've come to accept that I don't know how to create a like button without the use of local storage. My inspiration for this is the BBC live text page but they're probably using some server side tech that detects a user and works around not having local storage or an account. Otherwise i don't know how to do it
                ...or I'm just missing something very obvious.
                there has to be vote manipulation protection of some sort that skips the front end entirely.
                 Maybe something blocks a client from multiple interactions etc in the server side.
             If that's the case then I think I need to stop worrying about this. I have a solution that works for my purposes(react development and learning) so its probably not a good idea to try and compete or compare myself with the BBC.

            ✔ Added Home button article view @done(20-10-22 12:54)
            ✔ Added Previous Article button to article view @done(20-10-22 12:54)
            ✔ Added Next Article button to article view @done(20-10-22 12:54)
                ✔ These buttons are quite janky as they will only work as long as the next/prev page id is numericly adjacent. (1>2>3 will work, 1>4>8 will not.) I just wanted the basic functionality in place as page id within the database is part of a wider problem I will need to fix at some point. @done(20-10-22 12:54)
            ✔ Added Tags to articles that will let you filter articles based on type of content @done(20-10-22 12:54)

                 Currently not working properly when on one of the tag pages. Could have left this out of this release but I wanted to include it as demo of what it will be. @done(20-10-22 12:54)
            ✔ Improved appearance of recommended reading bar. @done(20-10-22 12:54)

This is the latest release note entry. In the future, I will leave the talking to the blog, but I wanted to leave something here to mark the point I finally caught up. Version 11 has been a milestone in my commitment to, and understanding of, React.js and I am proud of where theKnews is at the moment. 

I've been hard at work for over 2 months trying to get this release right, thinking I was close only to notice that I needed to rip out a quarter of the code and redo it, as you can see in Version 11 where I did that 3 times. I would go as far as to say, that, unlike triggers broom, V11 is a completley different website from V10, fundamental aesthetics aside.

It's a project literally years in the making and I'm looking forward to where it goes next.

My version numbers are...a choice. I am aware of that but they make sense to me so it's never really bothered me that much. Just know that the 11.1 to 11.5 was me trying to fix an issue with React Router and the .4 was tweaking the infinite scroll detection rate. In hindsight I should have probably gone for something like 11.0.1, 11.0.1.1, 11.0.1.2 etc but I didn't so 11.5.4 is what I ended up with for a release that is a few small bug fixes and not a piece of software getting a mid life update.
