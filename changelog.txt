GOAL:

        


10 August 2018
        Connected project to firebase database
        Successfully displayed information from the database
        Setup a form that allows users to enter data and show on website. This was removed but will be added back in later
        When you click on a home page news item you will be taken to a page with information from the database rather than the local json file like before
        All of the above works when upload to the porfolio
        Home page now loads from database instead of local file


3 August 2018
        Used html-react-parser to get html from json file rendered correctly to page
        Deployed project to portfolio for testing and letting people know I am busy.
        Created a message for WIP deployment
        Removed footer for deployment because its' a bit naff and I want to work on it later.

        Improved appearance and changed position of back button to be below banner images.
        Tweaked navbar appearance, should look better across resolutions
        Added some basic styles to footer, ugly as hell but gives me a start
        Added Split Banner Image for news page at beyond 1920px wide
        Tweaks to Responsiveness by removing max-width limit for news header image

2 August 2018

        Added the react-responsive library so I should be able to more easily design for responsive.

31 July 2018 - 
        Cracked the shareable urls
        Starting to populate and style the website
        Added random images to home page and news pages.
        
30 July 2018 - What I Did today
        Spent the entire day working on the shareable urls
        Made a breakthrough towards the end of the end of the day that will allow me to proceed
        Will develop more tommorow.

26 July 2018 - What I Did today:
        ✔ Figured out how to add a new line to JSON data.
        ✔ Made some progress with Unique IDs but hit some roadblocks. I feel like I am so close to a breakthrough
        ✔ I managed to get unique shareable urls working. You can manually navigation to any page provided the id of the page exists in the database. There is still a lot of work to be done here as I have detailed in the todo file. Basically I think I need to completley overhaul the way I am retrieving the data and displaying it on page.
